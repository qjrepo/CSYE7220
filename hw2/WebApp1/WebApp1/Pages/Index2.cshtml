<i>[Chorus (2x):]</i><br>
Last Christmas<br>
I gave you my heart<br>
But the very next day you gave it away.<br>
This year<br>
To save me from tears<br>
I'll give it to someone special.<br>
<br>
Once bitten and twice shy<br>
I keep my distance<br>
But you still catch my eye.<br>
Tell me, baby,<br>
Do you recognize me?<br>
Well,<br>
It's been a year,<br>
It doesn't surprise me<br>
(Merry Christmas)<br>
<br>
I wrapped it up and sent it<br>
With a note saying, &quot;I love you,&quot;<br>
I meant it<br>
Now I know what a fool I've been.<br>
But if you kissed me now<br>
I know you'd fool me again.<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus 2x]</i><br>
<br>
Oh, oh, baby.<br>
<br>
A crowded room,<br>
Friends with tired eyes.<br>
I'm hiding from you<br>
And your soul of ice.<br>
My god I thought you were someone to rely on.<br>
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on.<br>
<br>
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart.<br>
A man under cover but you tore me apart, ooh-hoo.<br>
Now I've found a real love, you'll never fool me again.<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus 2x]</i><br>
<br>
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart (I gave you my heart)<br>
A man under cover but you tore him apart<br>
Maybe next year I'll give it to someone<br>
I'll give it to someone special.<br>
<br>
Special...<br>
Someone...
